Hi there, I'm Rebecca 👋

I am a multidisciplinary software developer bridging the gap between traditional software architecture and emerging technologies. I specialize in architecting full-stack web applications, engineering secure blockchain products, and integrating AI/ML systems to build intelligent, scalable solutions.
Beyond pushing code, I lead software development and tech training initiatives focusing on building robust digital products and equipping the next generation of developers with practical engineering skills.

What I Do:
- Web Development: Building responsive, high-performance web applications and robust APIs to serve as the backbone for modern digital products.
  
- Blockchain & Web3: Developing decentralized applications (dApps), secure smart contracts, and exploring tokenomics and crypto ecosystems.
- 
- AI & Machine Learning: Implementing intelligent models, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipelines, and autonomous agents into production-ready software.
  
- Tech Leadership: Driving tech education, mentoring, and fostering developer communities through structured, hands-on training programs.
  
Current Focus:
- Architecting scalable web platforms and decentralized solutions.
- Exploring the intersection of generative AI and traditional software engineering.
- Expanding tuition-free engineering internships to lower the barrier to entry in tech.
